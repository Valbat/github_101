#Git and GitHub Cheatsheets
I think the best way to start to learn git and GitHub is to think about common workflows, thus, these cheatsheets are built around this idea. Included in this cheatsheet are:

- [Git setup](#git-setup)
- [GitHub setup](#github-setup)
- [Git command line](#git-command-line)
- [Git and GitHub with RStudio](#git-and-github-with-rstudio)
- [Collaborating with GitHub](#collaborating-with-github)
