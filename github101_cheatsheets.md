#Git and GitHub Cheatsheets
I think the best way to start to learn git and GitHub is to think about common workflows, thus, these cheatsheets are built around this idea. Included in this cheatsheet are:

- [Git setup](#git-setup)
- [GitHub setup](#github-setup)
- [Git command line](#git-command-line)
- [Git and GitHub with RStudio](#git-and-github-with-rstudio)
- [Collaborating with GitHub](#collaborating-with-github)
- [Help and other stuff](#help-and-other-stuff)

###A word about .gitignore
The `.gitignore` file allows you to have files and folders stored in a git repository that aren't tracked by git.  This is handy.  Instead of going into great detail on this, I just wanted to point it out.  I showed this when I created a repository on GitHub, but do make sure to use a `.gitignore` file.  The best one for R projects is going to be the one you can choose on GitHub.  If you forget you can always grab a copy of that from the [GitHub/gitignore repo] (https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/R.gitignore).
